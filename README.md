# urban-octo-telegram

This project is refactoring the HTML and CSS for an existing webpage to optimize for search engines. The original HTML doesn't have a website title, attribute for images, and proper tag name. In the CSS file, there are multiple selectors have the same property which can be simplified and combine to shorten the code. The original CSS has about 200 lines of code. After combining some tags and changing tag name, the CSS now has about 120 lines and the HTML looks more clean and easier to find specific section. 

[Here](https://maggie9685.github.io/urban-octo-telegram/) is the final result, and it should look exactly like the follow image.
